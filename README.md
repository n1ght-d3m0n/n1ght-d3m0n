<h4 align="center">About Me</h4>

<p align="justify">👋 Hello there! I'm a second-year B.Tech Computer Science student with a passion for full-stack development.
 
🎓 Majoring in full-stack development, I'm constantly exploring the world of web technologies and honing my skills in both front-end and back-end development.
 
🌐 I thrive on building robust and user-friendly applications that seamlessly integrate the best of both worlds. I love the challenge of bringing ideas to life and I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field.
 
📚 When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new libraries, experimenting with new frameworks, or contributing to open-source projects. I believe in the power of collaboration and enjoy working with a team to tackle complex problems and create innovative solutions.
 
🏆 As a lifelong learner, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to grow and enhance my skills. I'm open to internships, projects, and collaborations that allow me to apply my knowledge and make a positive impact in the world of technology.
